# Maze-Runner
A simple maze game with small obstacles made using turbo C

NOTE:As we used conio.h header file,this code cannot be executed in linux.

1. The game consists of a maze with some hurdles in between,the ball should move from entry to the exit using the arrow keys.

2. As you start moving the number of moves increments by one and when you jump the hurdles number of moves decreases by 2 (a reward to the player )

3. When the ball strikes the walls of the maze,it gives a warning saying “Invalid Input”.

4. When the ball reaches the exit, the number of stars are displayed based on no.of moves.i.e. the range of moves for the stars to be awarded is defined . 
<b>Lesser the number of moves,higher is the number of stars.</b>

5.You can exit the game anytime by just pressing escape.
